# Contribution Guidelines
This document isn't very well detailed at the moment...

## Guidelines
1. Make sure your PR compiles. If the GitHub action "Rust âœ…/ ðŸš«" fails, your PR will be declined.
2. Make sure your commit changes something other than just formatting.
3. If you change updates any of the `Cargo.toml` files, make sure to
   [install](https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps#installation) and run `cargo +nightly udeps` to
   make sure there aren't any unused dependencies.
